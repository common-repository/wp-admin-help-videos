Add help videos and screen recordings to the WordPress admin help tabs

== Description ==

Add help videos and screen recordings to the WordPress admin help tabs.

Browser Support:
*	Chrome, FF, Edge
*	Safari not currently supported (coming soon)

This plugin is for WordPress developers or trainers who wish to add 'how to' videos to the WordPress admin. This plugin lets you:

*	Record a screen recording (with audio) directly from the WordPress admin panel in your browser - no need for 3rd party video screen recording software.
*	Add a title and description to the video.
*	Place the video on any WordPress admin page (even plugins) within the Help dropdown tab, meaning the video will be available directly on the page it is related to.

Do you ever hand over a WordPress website to a client, only for them to ask lots of questions about how to administer the website? Using this plugin, you can now direct these clients to screen recordings to train them on exactly what you need to.

Note: recording videos works best in Chrome.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I record a video? =

Click on "Start Recording" from the Admin Video menu within the WordPress admin top toolbar.

= How do I attach the video to a specific admin page? =

Start recording the video on the page you want it to appear on. Whilst you are recording the video, you can navigate around the website if you need. The video will end up on the admin page you started recording.

Please note, when you stop recording, you need to be back in the admin panel in your browser to allow the video to save.

= Where can I access my video files? =

The plugin saves all recordings into your wp-content/uploads folder, inside a folder called admin-help-videos. They are not publicly available due to .htaccess restrictions. If you are using nginx you will need to secure this folder another way.
